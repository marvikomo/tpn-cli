# Contributing

Contribtutions are welcome.

For issues and requests:

- Please open an issue for bugs, feature requests, or questions. Keep in mind we are a small team and may not be able to respond immediately.

For pull requests:

- For bugs: feel free to open an pull request with a fix.
- For features: please open an issue to discuss the feature before submitting a pull request. We'd hate to waste your time on a feature that we don't want to merge.

Workflow guidelines:

- All changes should be opened as a pull request against the `development` branch
- We like using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) in our commit messages

## Runing tests

Whenever you make changes, please run the test suite by running `sh ./tests.sh` in the root directory.
